# Example 1: <a href="https://www.johnwoodsweet.com">John Wood Sweet</a>

## Layout: Needs Improvement

The layout displays some formatting (separate tabs for other books and so on,) but much of the material is all on the same page with no real indication that scrolling down will result in anything. I actually witnessed the problems with this in a class - we were looking for the storymap link and almost did not find it because it was not linked at the top or indicated.

## Content: Exemplary

The reason I selected this site is the content Sweet included, which displays a lot of his work and skills in engaging ways that draw in readers who might only be looking because they read his book. As noted, the links to the various resources need better placement/indication, but their inclusion makes the site more useful and engaging than a simple "About Me" and book list would be.

I also noticed that sharing his data for the general public's perusal is reminiscent of Fitzpatrick's suggestions. I still do not agree with her overall ideas (at least in the form presented,) but having looked at this site with fresh eyes I can definitely see the value in sharing the evidence we're working with more broadly.

# Example 2: <a href="https://serenazabin.com"> Serena Zabin</a>

## Layout: Highly Navigable

This site has many more tabs and much smaller pages - no scrolling endlessly to be surprised by resources at the bottom. I personally would like to do more stylization with my site, but this level of clarity as to where things are and how to reach them is definitely an example I want to follow.

## Content: Solid

I'm especially impressed by her "writing history for the future" section. Obviously the site has not been updated in several years, but I like the idea of a call to action for general readers. I overall prefer Sweet's content due to the additional projects/inclusion of sources, but this site is also an example I want to follow. 

My one critique is the Events tab - as can be seen by the fact that several 2021 events are listed as "upcoming", it seems like a feature that requires more attention than one might want to put in. I think some kind of "news" section used like a blog (look, another Fitzpatrick suggestion) might be an easier way to achieve that without having to go back into the code after every event.

# Additional Research

I actually struggled to find two sites from historians. I knew Sweet's because I'd already looked at it, but got stuck looking for the second. I searched a number of historians I know of and admire and they don't have sites. Zabin was literally last on my list before I started searching "famous historians" out of desperation. It really drove home how under-utilized these tools are - the people I know of have great projects or important interventions, but if you search them the best you get is college pages and newspaper articles. There's no central repository of their work from their own perspective.
