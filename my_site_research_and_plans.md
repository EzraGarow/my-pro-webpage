# Basic Research

## <a href=https://www.askamanager.org> AskAManager</a>

I went to the AskAManager website first (I've gotten a lot of great professional advice from there and I know she's opined on many topics) and sure enough, there were two posts about personal websites that actually seemed very useful! Specifically, I learned what *not* to do. Both posts discussed the need for a site to include some kind of interactive component - as in, things to click, multiple pages, etc. - and relevant content beyond name and resume.

Obviously, we've been working on these sites with the assumption that they would include projects, so I don't think I was in danger of making a website that didn't meet those criteria, but it was useful to see those critiques and how they would be perceived laid out for me.

This site was pretty much what we've talked about in class, but I found it useful to see the ideas laid out in a different way. The reminder that one could include a teaching page was also helpful - I have a syllabus I made in Teaching College History of which I'm quite proud, and I would like to include it. (It is relevant to digital history work - the proposed class would use a lot of digital resources due to a dearth of traditional publishing on the topic and the importance of the internet for a lot of the phenomena studied.)

# Site Goals

I would like to make a site that functions both as a repository of my work and a job search aid. I'm envisioning something with Sweet's content, Zabin's layout, and some additional pages with my CV and sample syllabus.

# Site Map

## Landing Page

Mainly decorative - basic information, some relevant images. Main features are a header with links to the other pages (About Me, Projects, Resources, Contact Me.) Might eventually include some links to specific resources or publications in the main body of the page

### About Me

Blurb, link to CV, link to syllabus

### Projects

Blurb about each project with a link to it

### Resources

Similar to Sweet's website - links to download data I've collected or found when it's safe to share it (I know Fitzpatrick would encourage doing it immediately, but with the current state of the field I don't think a student can afford to attempt that level of collaboration)

### Contact Me

LinkedIn, email, etc.

# Rationale/Other Thoughts

I've explained my thinking somewhat above and in the "Example_Sites" file, but to bring it all together:

I think it is important to have a site with a good amount of content so that people understand why it's there (as opposed to one or two page sites that can read like an pointless "online business card.") I also think it is important for those sites to be easy to navigate, so that people know how to get where they need to immediately.

To that end, I want an uncluttered main page, with four pages representing major divisions in content linked at the top.

I'd bundle the CV and syllabus in with the "About Me" both to limit site complexity (some interaction is good, but too many pages can cause problems as well) and to keep relevant information as consolidated as possible without becoming unwieldy.

Projects and Resources would be separated so that people don't have to try to parse what's a complete project they can read but not modify vs. a dataset that's actually set up to be used.

Contact Me would be separate from "About Me" mainly for convention reasons - I think people expect to see a "Contact Me" in the corner of a webpage, and I've found that people are more likely to trust sites that conform to their expectations.

## Other Design Elements

Color-wise, I'm always fond of a nice sepia for historical work - it seems fitting - and I like green, but that's obviously subject to change for accessibility reasons.

I'd like the links to specific resources on the main page to be images, because I like the way that looks and I think it appears slightly more polished than text on buttons.
